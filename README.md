# AI-VIRTUAL-MOUSE
 The AI Virtual Mouse project is an innovative solution that enables hands-free control of the computer mouse using hand gestures. Leveraging computer vision and machine learning techniques, this Python-based application utilizes a webcam to capture real-time hand movements.These gestures are then processed to control the mouse cursor, offering users an intuitive and interactive way to interact with their computers.

Key Features
Gesture Control: Navigate the mouse cursor by moving your hand in front of the webcam.
Click Actions: Perform left and right clicks using specific hand gestures.
User-Friendly Interface: Simple and intuitive controls make it accessible for users of all levels.

Requirements
Python 3.x
OpenCV: Computer vision library for image processing.
MediaPipe: Framework for building multimodal (camera and hand tracking) applied solutions.
PyAutoGUI: Python module for programmatically controlling the mouse and keyboard.
